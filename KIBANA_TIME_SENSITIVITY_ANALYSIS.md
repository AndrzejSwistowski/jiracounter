# Kibana Bar Visualization Time Period Sensitivity - Analysis & Solutions

## üîç **Why Your Bar Visualization is Time-Sensitive**

### **Primary Causes:**

1. **Time-based Filtering on @timestamp**
   - Your queries filter by `@timestamp : [now-30d TO now]`
   - This field represents when issues became "done"
   - Different time periods have different completion patterns

2. **Development Time Data Changes Over Time**
   - Team processes evolve
   - Different types of work in different periods
   - Varying team sizes and experience levels
   - Process improvements affect cycle times

3. **Incomplete Current Period Data**
   - Issues started recently may not be complete yet
   - This skews recent data toward shorter completion times
   - Creates artificial patterns based on selection period

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions to Reduce Time Sensitivity**

### **Solution 1: Use Issue Creation Date Instead**
Instead of filtering by completion date (`@timestamp`), filter by creation date:

```json
{
  "range": {
    "issue.created": {
      "gte": "now-90d",
      "lte": "now-30d"
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this helps:**
- Focuses on issues that had enough time to complete
- Avoids bias from incomplete current work
- More stable view of actual throughput patterns

### **Solution 2: Add Minimum Development Time Filter**
Exclude very quick completions that may skew data:

```json
{
  "range": {
    "from_selected_for_development.working_minutes": {
      "gte": 60,
      "lt": 14400
    }
  }
}
```

**This excludes:**
- Issues completed in < 1 hour (likely data errors)
- Issues taking > 30 days (outliers that skew distribution)

### **Solution 3: Use Rolling Average Approach**
Create a more stable view by using longer time windows:

```json
{
  "range": {
    "@timestamp": {
      "gte": "now-6M",
      "lte": "now"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Smoother, more representative data
- Less sensitive to daily/weekly variations
- Better trend visibility

### **Solution 4: Fixed Time Windows for Comparison**
Instead of relative dates, use fixed periods:

```json
{
  "range": {
    "@timestamp": {
      "gte": "2024-01-01",
      "lte": "2024-03-31"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß **Updated Kibana Configuration**

Here's an improved configuration that reduces time sensitivity:

### **Enhanced Filters for Stability:**

1. **Completed Issues with Sufficient Data:**
```
issue.status.name_lower : "done" AND 
@timestamp : [now-6M TO now-7d] AND
from_selected_for_development.working_minutes : [60 TO 14400]
```

2. **Exclude Current Week (Incomplete Data):**
```
@timestamp : [now-6M TO now-7d]
```

3. **Focus on Representative Work:**
```
from_selected_for_development.working_minutes : [60 TO 14400]
```

## üéØ **Recommended Implementation**

### **Step 1: Update Your Bar Chart Filters**

Replace the current time filter with:
- **Time Range**: `@timestamp : [now-6M TO now-7d]`
- **Development Time Range**: `from_selected_for_development.working_minutes : [60 TO 14400]`
- **Status Filter**: `issue.status.name_lower : "done"`

### **Step 2: Create Comparison Visualizations**

Create multiple charts for different time periods:
1. **Last 6 months** (excluding current week)
2. **Previous 6 months** (6-12 months ago)
3. **Quarter-over-quarter comparison**

### **Step 3: Add Statistical Context**

Include these metrics alongside your histogram:
- **Median development time** (less sensitive to outliers)
- **25th and 75th percentiles** (quartile ranges)
- **Sample size** (number of issues in analysis)

## üìä **Expected Improvements**

With these changes, your visualization should:

‚úÖ **Be more stable** across different time selections
‚úÖ **Show consistent patterns** regardless of current date  
‚úÖ **Exclude incomplete/skewed data** from current period
‚úÖ **Focus on representative work** (not outliers or errors)
‚úÖ **Provide meaningful comparisons** across time periods

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Always exclude the current week** - incomplete data skews results
2. **Use longer time windows** for stable patterns (3-6 months minimum)
3. **Set reasonable bounds** on development time to exclude outliers
4. **Consider team changes** when comparing different time periods
5. **Document your time selection logic** for consistent analysis

This approach will give you a much more stable and reliable throughput analysis that focuses on actual development patterns rather than artifacts of time period selection!
